# 🎓 Vouch - Blockchain Resume Verification

A complete platform for issuing and verifying work experience credentials using Solana blockchain. Share your verified resume via a public link in job applications!

## ✨ Key Features

- 🔐 **User Authentication** - Sign up with email/password, auto-generate Solana wallet
- 📝 **Request Verification** - Submit work experience for employer approval
- ✅ **Employer Dashboard** - Approve/reject requests, mint blockchain tokens
- 🔗 **Public Vouch Profile** - Share `/vouch/username` in job applications
- ⛓️ **Blockchain Verified** - All credentials stored on Solana
- 🚀 **No Wallet Extension** - Everything handled in-app

## 🎯 Use Case

> **Problem**: Resumes can be faked, verification is slow and expensive  
> **Solution**: Employers issue blockchain tokens to verify credentials  
> **Result**: Instant, trustworthy verification via shareable public links

**Example Flow:**
1. Otis worked at Meta 2022-2024
2. Otis requests verification through Vouch
3. Meta's HR approves → mints token to Otis's wallet
4. Otis applies to Google, shares `/vouch/otis`
5. Google recruiter sees blockchain-verified Meta credential instantly

## 🚀 Quick Start

### 1. Installation
```bash
npm install
```

### 2. Supabase Setup

1. Go to [supabase.com](https://supabase.com) and create an account
2. Create a new project (takes ~2 minutes)
3. Go to **SQL Editor** and run these files **in order**:
   - First: `SQL_SCHEMA.sql` (creates tables)
   - Then: `SQL_UPDATE.sql` (adds auth fields)
4. Go to **Project Settings → API** and copy:
   - Project URL
   - `anon` public key
   - `service_role` key (click "Reveal")
5. Update `.env.local` with your Supabase credentials:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your_url_here
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your_anon_key_here
SUPABASE_SERVICE_ROLE_KEY=your_service_role_key_here
```

### 3. Create Employer Accounts

For testing, you'll need to create employer accounts in Supabase Auth:

1. Go to **Supabase Dashboard → Authentication → Users**
2. Click "Add User" and create accounts for test employers:
   - Email: `hr@meta.com`, Password: (your choice)
   - Email: `hr@google.com`, Password: (your choice)
3. Copy the `auth_id` for each user
4. Go to **SQL Editor** and link them to employers:

```sql
UPDATE employers 
SET auth_id = 'paste-auth-id-here' 
WHERE email = 'hr@meta.com';
```

### 4. Run the App

```bash
npm run dev
```

Visit `http://localhost:3000`

## 📖 How to Use

### As a User:

1. Click "Get Started" on homepage
2. Sign up with email, password, and choose a username
3. Solana wallet is automatically generated for you
4. Submit verification requests for your work experience
5. Copy your public vouch link: `/vouch/your-username`

### As an Employer:

1. Log in with employer email (e.g., `hr@meta.com`)
2. See pending verification requests for your company
3. Review proof links (LinkedIn, etc.)
4. Approve → Blockchain token minted to user's wallet
5. User's credential now appears on their public profile

## 🗄️ Database Schema

### Main Tables:

- **users** - User accounts with wallet addresses and usernames
- **employers** - Hard-coded employer/institution accounts
- **credential_requests** - Verification requests (pending/approved/rejected)
- **job_postings** - (Future) Job board with credential requirements

All tables include `auth_id` linking to Supabase Auth for authentication.

## 🔐 Security Features

- ✅ Password authentication via Supabase Auth
- ✅ Protected routes with middleware
- ✅ Role-based access control (user vs employer)
- ✅ Session management with auto-refresh
- ✅ Public profiles only show approved credentials
- ✅ Blockchain-backed credential verification

## 🛠️ Available Scripts

2. See the approved, blockchain-verified credential

## 📝 Environment Variables

## 🔒 Security Notes

- `issuer-keypair.json` contains private key - **NEVER commit!** (already in `.gitignore`)
- This is a DEVNET project - requires additional security for production
- Employer accounts are manually verified for security
- All credentials are immutable once minted

## 🎯 Pages & Routes

| Route | Access | Description |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| `/` | Public | Landing page |
| `/signup` | Public | User registration |
| `/login` | Public | Login with role detection |
| `/dashboard` | Protected (User) | User dashboard |
| `/employer` | Protected (Employer) | Employer dashboard |
| `/vouch/[username]` | Public | Shareable credential profile |

## 💡 Why Vouch?

Traditional resume verification:
- ❌ Slow (weeks for background checks)
- ❌ Expensive ($50-200 per check)
- ❌ Trust-based (can be faked)
- ❌ Centralized (data silos)

Vouch verification:
- ✅ Instant (view public profile)
- ✅ Free (blockchain storage)
- ✅ Cryptographically verified
- ✅ Decentralized (user owns credentials)
